In the scenario we are taking into consideration, we assume the following domain assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

	\item {[D1]}: Customers respect the \gls{dpcm} impositions.
	\item {[D2]}: If customers have lined up from remote, they shall approach to the store with the smartphone.
	\item {[D3]}: If customers indicate the category of products they would buy, they won't buy other things.
	\item {[D4]}: Customers lining up remotely shall have a \gls{gps} module inside the smartphone.
	\item {[D5]}: Customers lining up remotely shall accept \gls{gps} localization permissions.
	\item {[D6]}: Customers lining up remotely shall keep Internet connection active.
	\item {[D7]}: Customers lining up remotely shall keep notification option active.
	\item {[D8]}: Customers enter in the store only if the system authorized them.
	\item {[D9]}: Customers go away from the store after they have done their shopping.
	\item {[D10]}: Customers lining up from the physical spot take care about the printed QR code.
	\item {[D11]}: Customers show the QR code to the scanner to be accepted by the system.

\end{itemize}
